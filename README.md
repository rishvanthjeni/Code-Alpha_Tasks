Developed a project using python for Code Alpha internship.
Task 1-Hangman Game
Developed a hangman problem using python for Code Alpha internship. Overview This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game in Python. In the game, the player has to guess a randomly chosen word by guessing one letter at a time. The player is given a set number of incorrect guesses before losing the game. The game provides feedback on whether the guessed letter is part of the word, and it also shows the partially guessed word as the game progresses.

Features: Random word selection from a predefined list. Player guesses one letter at a time. Display of the word with correctly guessed letters filled in. Feedback on incorrect guesses with a limited number of attempts. A game-over condition once the player runs out of guesses or guesses the word correctly. Play again option after the game ends. Requirements To run the game, you need Python 3.x installed on your system.

You can check if you have Python installed by running:

python --version Installation Clone the Repository: If this project is hosted on GitHub or any other repository, you can clone it using Git:

git clone <repository_url> Run the Code:

After cloning or downloading the project, navigate to the project folder in your terminal or command prompt. Run the Python script:

python hangman.py How to Play When the game starts, a random word will be selected. The player will be prompted to guess a letter. If the guessed letter is in the word, it will appear in the word's current blank positions. If the guessed letter is incorrect, the player loses one of their allowed attempts. The player can keep guessing letters until they either: Guess all the letters of the word correctly. Run out of allowed incorrect guesses (the hangman is "fully drawn"). The game ends when one of the above conditions is met, and the player is asked if they want to play again.
Task 2- Stock Portfolio
Overview
The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive platform that allows users to:

Add and remove stocks to/from their portfolio.
Track the current value of their stocks and overall portfolio performance.
Visualize stock trends using graphs and charts.
Simulate potential investment scenarios.
Generate performance reports based on historical stock data.
Features
Stock Portfolio Tracking: Add stocks to your portfolio, track the number of shares, and monitor current stock prices.
Real-Time Stock Data: Integration with financial APIs to fetch real-time stock prices.
Portfolio Overview: View the total value of your portfolio, individual stock performance, and overall profit/loss.
Charts and Visualization: Generate charts to visualize the performance of individual stocks and the entire portfolio.
Search Functionality: Search for stock symbols, retrieve details, and get price alerts.
Performance Reports: Generate detailed performance reports for your stock investments, including daily, monthly, and yearly summaries.

Task 3-Chatbot
Overview
The goal of this project is to create an intelligent, interactive chatbot that can:

Engage in dynamic conversations with users.
Provide answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs).
Assist users in completing tasks (e.g., booking, product recommendations, etc.).
Learn from user interactions to improve over time.
Integrate with messaging platforms (e.g., Slack, Telegram) or be deployed as a web-based interface.
Features
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Understand and process user inputs using NLP techniques.
Predefined Response System: Handle common user queries with predefined responses.
Machine Learning Integration: Use machine learning models to predict and generate dynamic responses.
Multiple Platform Support: Integrate with popular messaging platforms like Slack, Telegram, or run as a web chatbot.
Learning Capabilities: Optionally, the chatbot can be designed to learn from past conversations to improve future interactions.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyze user sentiment and adjust responses accordingly.
Conversation History: Keep track of previous conversations to make the chatbot more personalized.
